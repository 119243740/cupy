# SGEMM example

This example contains implementation of single-precision general matrix-multiplication  (SGEMM).
The implementation is based on [MAGMA](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/) implementation.


### How to demo
The demo contains a script that calculates matrix multiplication of A (m x k) and B (k x n).
The demo can be run by the following command.

```
python sgemm.py [--m m] [--n n] [--k k]
```
